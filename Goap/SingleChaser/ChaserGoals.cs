    ///
    ///   1. CatchPlayer      — highest priority. Fires when the player is
    ///                          detected (seen, or a fresh last-known position).
    ///   2. InvestigateSound — middle priority. Fires when a sound (e.g. a
    ///                          generator being switched on) has been reported
    ///                          but the player isn't currently detected. The
    ///                          chaser goes to the SOUND'S location to check it
    ///                          out (interpretation A).
    ///   3. Wander           — the fallback. Always achievable, lowest priority,
    ///                          so it only runs when nothing else applies.
    ///
    /// There is deliberately NO "survive" goal: the enemy can't be beaten, so it
    /// never retreats. This keeps the whole decision space to "how do I find and
    /// reach the player", which is exactly the tension a stealth-horror chaser
    /// should have.
    ///
    /// Goal selection (in SquadAgent.SelectGoal) picks the highest-priority goal
    /// whose desired state is NOT already satisfied. Because Wander's desired
    /// fact is never "already true", it's always available as a floor — but its
    /// low priority means chase/investigate win whenever their facts are set.
